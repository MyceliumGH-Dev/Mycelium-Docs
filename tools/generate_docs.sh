# canvas (GH_Canvas.GenerateHiResImage), so a canvas -- and therefore a logged-in GUI
# session -- must exist. It is UNATTENDED, not headless: Rhino will open, work, and quit on
# its own. Do not expect it to run over ssh or from a cron job with no desktop; a launchd
# *user agent* is fine.
#
# Requires: Rhino 8 (licensed, with Mycelium installed) and Pillow for the crop step
# (pip install pillow). Set RHINO_APP to override the install location.
